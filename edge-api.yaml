        https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/ for
        more information. As such, it's not possible to define something like:

        ``polymorphic_context`` can not be a PolymorphicSerializer itself, as it requires
        access to the ``object_type`` in the parent scope.
