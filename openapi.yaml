  description: "## Get started\n\nThe **Azion API** is a _RESTful API_ based on _HTTPS_\
    \ requests that allows users to fully interact with Azion products through API\
    \ requests.\n\n### **Requirements**\n\nTo run **Azion API** requests you need:\n\
    \n- An [Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/)\
    \ account;\n- A [Personal Token](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/)\
    \ or;\n- An Access Token.\n\n### **Rate limit**\n\nThe limit of operations that\
    \ can be run via the API is defined by three HTTP response headers:\n\n\\* **X-ratelimit-limit:**\
    \ number of operations allowed in one time-frame;\n\n\\* **X-ratelimit-remaining:**\
    \ number of operations still available in one time-frame;\n\n\\* **X-ratelimit-reset:**\
    \ the date and time, in ISO 8601 format. It represents the point in the future\
    \ when the time-frame will be closed and when the limits will, therefore, be reset.\n\
    \nExample of `curl` request and HTTP response headers:\n```\ncurl --location 'https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/workspace/applications'\
    \ \\\n  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  --header 'Authorization: Token\
    \ TOKEN-VALUE'\n\nDate: Mon, 20 Aug 2025 12:07:46 -0300\nx-ratelimit-limit: 200\n\
    x-ratelimit-remaining: 199\nx-ratelimit-reset: 2025-08-20T12:07:46.418804\n```\n\
    \nIn the example provided, 200 operations are allowed within a 1-minute time frame.\
    \ Of those, there are 199 still available, because one has already been run. The\
    \ total limit will be reset after 1 minute.\n\nWhen the **X-ratelimit-limit**\
    \ is reached, or in other words, when the **X-ratelimit-remaining** reaches zero,\
    \ the API will give the error, HTTP 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS. If your application\
    \ receives this error, you'll need to wait until the time defined in **X-ratelimit-reset**\
    \ has passed, to make another request.\n\n\\* **X-ratelimit-limit by product**\n\
    \nThe **X-ratelimit limit variation by product** is:\n\n\\* **Real-Time Purge:**\
    \ 200 requests per minute; except for the Wildcard purge, which is 2000 a day.\n\
    \n> The rate-limit values are based on the `client_id` (per account).\n\n### **Status\
    \ codes**\n\nThe HTTP return code defines the status (successful or not) after\
    \ the requested operation is run.\n\n| Status Code               | Description\
    \                       |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------\
    \ |\n| 200 OK                    | General status for a successful operation.\
    \ |\n| 201 CREATED               | Successfully created a collection or item,\
    \ through POST or PUT. |\n| 202 ACCEPTED              | The request has been accepted\
    \ for processing, but the processing has not been completed. |\n| 207 MULTI-STATUS\
    \          | A batch of operations were triggered by a single request, which resulted\
    \ in different return codes when it was run, for some of the operations. The codes\
    \ are displayed in the \"status\" field, in the body of the response, for each\
    \ sub-batch of operations for whichever are applicable. |\n| 400 BAD REQUEST \
    \          | Request error, such as invalid parameters, missing mandatory parameters\
    \ or others. |\n| 401 UNAUTHORIZED          | Error caused by a missing HTTP Authentication\
    \ header. |\n| 403 FORBIDDEN             | User doesn't have the permission to\
    \ run the requested operation. |\n| 404 NOT FOUND             | The requested\
    \ resource doesn't exist. |\n| 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED    | The requested method\
    \ isn't applicable with the URL. |\n| 406 NOT ACCEPTABLE        | Accept header\
    \ missing from the HTTP request or the header contains formatting or the version\
    \ isn't supported by the API. |\n| 409 CONFLICT              | Conflict generated\
    \ in running the request, such as a request to create an already existing record.\
    \ |\n| 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS     | The request was temporarily rejected, due to\
    \ exceeding the limit on operations. Wait for the time defined in the X-Ratelimit-Reset\
    \ header and try again. |\n| 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR | Unintentional error,\
    \ due to an unidentified failure in the request process. |\n\n\n### **Filtering\
    \ and sorting**\n\nIn this version, it's possible to include some optional parameters\
    \ as part of the GET method. It can help and modify the form in which your data\
    \ will be returned.\n\nYou can combine these parameters to get the result you\
    \ want.\n\nThey are:\n\n| Parameter | Description   | Accepted values | Examples\
    \ |\n| ---       | ---           | ---             | ---     |\n| ordering  |\
    \ Identifies which field the return should be sorted by. The default ordering\
    \ is ascending. | field: for asc sorting <br> -field: for desc sorting | name,\
    \ -name |\n| page      | Identifies which page should be returned, if the return\
    \ is paginated. The default value is 1. | Page number. | 2, 3, 4, ... |\n| page_size\
    \ | Identifies how many items should be returned per page. The default value is\
    \ 10. | Desired number of items. | 20, 50, 100, ... |\n| search    | Search for\
    \ an specific value in any column. | Desired value. | \"value\" |\n\n\n#### **Request\
    \ example**\n\nYou can use one parameter, or a combination. Check the example\
    \ below, which uses all of them in the same request.\n\n```\ncurl --location 'https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/workspace/firewalls?ordering=name&page=3&page_size=20'\
    \ \\\n--header 'Authorization: Token TOKEN-VALUE'\n```\n\n### Authentication Methods\n\
    The Azion API offers two ways to authenticate and authorize your operations:\n\
    \n1. **Personal Tokens:** You can create a personal token by logging into your\
    \ account on the [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/personal-tokens). \n\
    2. **Access Tokens:** You can generate access tokens directly via the API using\
    \ your email and password through the [https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/account/auth/login](/v4#/operations/PostAuthLogin)\
    \ endpoint. This method is only supported for API version 4 endpoints.\n\nBoth\
    \ methods provide secure access to the API. Choose the one that best suits your\
    \ workflow.\n\nIf you don't have an account yet, you can create one by referring\
    \ to our [documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/).\
    \ Enterprise account users should contact their administrator to obtain a token.\n\
    \n\n## Using GraphQL APIs\n\nIn addition to the RESTful API, Azion also offers\
    \ GraphQL APIs, accessible through a different URL. To use the GraphQL APIs, send\
    \ requests to:\n\n| Type | URL   |\n| ---       | ---           |\n| Accounting\
    \ | https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/accounting/graphql |\n| Billing | https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/billing/graphql\
    \ |\n| Events | https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/events/graphql |\n| Metrics | https://stage-api.azion.com/v4/metrics/graphql\
    \ |\n\nThis endpoint allows you to interact with Azion services using GraphQL\
    \ queries, offering more flexibility and efficiency when working with complex\
    \ data structures.\n"
