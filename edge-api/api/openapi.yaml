        Note that the discriminator field must exist at the same depth as the mapped
        serializer fields for the OpenAPI introspection. See
        https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/ for
        more information. As such, it's not possible to define something like:

        }

        without explicitly wrapping this in a parent serializer, i.e. -
        ``polymorphic_context`` can not be a PolymorphicSerializer itself, as it requires
        access to the ``object_type`` in the parent scope.

        Polymorphic serializer base class.

        Note that the discriminator field must exist at the same depth as the mapped
        serializer fields for the OpenAPI introspection. See
        https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/ for
        more information. As such, it's not possible to define something like:

        {
            "object_type": "foo",
            "polymorphic_context": {
                <foo-specific fields>
            }
        }

        without explicitly wrapping this in a parent serializer, i.e. -
        ``polymorphic_context`` can not be a PolymorphicSerializer itself, as it requires
        access to the ``object_type`` in the parent scope.
