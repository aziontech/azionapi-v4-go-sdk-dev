        A Network List item can be one of the following formats:


        1. IP Addresses (IPv4/IPv6):

            - Simple IPv4: 192.168.0.1

            - IPv4 with CIDR: 192.168.0.1/24

            - Simple IPv6: 2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888

            - IPv6 with CIDR: 2001:db8::/32

            - IP with expiration date: 192.168.0.1 --LT2025-05-29T12:25:23Z

                (The expiration date format is --LT followed by ISO8601 date in UTC timezone)


        2. Country Codes:

            - Two-character uppercase alphanumeric country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
